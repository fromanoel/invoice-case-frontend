## ðŸš€ Getting Started
This project uses the OpenAI API and requires a valid API key to run locally.

## ðŸš¨ Alert
The backend is hosted on Render using a free plan, which may cause the server to enter sleep mode after periods of inactivity.

As a result, the first request may take a few extra seconds to respond. This is expected behavior, and performance will return to normal afterward.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm

## ðŸ§¾ Description

This is the frontend of a web application built with **Next.js**, designed to:

- Allow users to upload invoice images
- Display extracted text from invoices processed via OCR and AI
- Provide a chat interface to ask questions about the invoice content
- Enable PDF download of the invoice, extracted text, and chat history
- Support user registration and login with JWT-based authentication
